## Cold Email

Hi \[Hiring Manager’s Name],

I’m reaching out to express my interest in the Senior Front-End Engineer role at \[Company]. With 6+ years building performant, accessible apps in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, I bring both technical depth and measurable results. At Cognizant, I led a React/TS migration that improved Lighthouse scores by 28% and increased conversion rates by 20%. I also built a Storybook-driven component library and integrated Jest/Cypress into CI/CD pipelines, aligning closely with your focus on performance optimization, accessibility, and robust testing.

I’d love to discuss how my background can help drive seamless, scalable experiences for your FinTech customers.

Best regards,
Alex Sharma
