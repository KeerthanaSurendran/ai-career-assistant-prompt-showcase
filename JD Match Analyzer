### **Partial Matches**

* **Analytics:** ⚠️ Resume doesn’t mention analytics specifically; could be inferred from conversion improvements, but not explicit.
* **Cross-functional collaboration:** ⚠️ Resume implies leadership and technical execution but doesn’t detail collaboration with design/product/analytics teams in narrative form.

### **Missing / Nice-to-Haves**

* **Node.js APIs:** ❌ Not listed.
* **AWS basics:** ❌ No mention of cloud experience.

---

### **Assessment**

* **Overall Fit:** ★★★★☆ (Very strong, \~85–90% match)
  Alex clearly meets all *core* technical requirements (React, Next.js, TypeScript, performance, WCAG, testing, CI/CD, state mgmt, design systems).
* **Gaps:** Lacks mention of analytics, Node.js, and AWS. These are “nice to haves,” not core blockers.
* **Positioning:** Candidate’s metrics (28% perf, 20% conversions, 32% bug reduction) show strong impact, making them attractive for a FinTech setting where performance and reliability are critical.
